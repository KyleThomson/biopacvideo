MainForm.cs (Seizure Playback)

Defined int fastReviewCounter (initialized at 0) to keep track of whether or not the fast review state has been entered yet

In method FastReview_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) (line: 1350):
	created bool del
		del is passed through to the deleteMessageBox() method, which returns true or false
		if true, del will delete all of the progress made during fast review
		if false, del will save the selected seizures and allow the user to go back and select more/less
	

Added stepping feature in "previous click" for fast review. 


MainForm.cs (Seizure Playback)
Defined string DSFoCount on line 74
	


DetSezLabel increased in length to fit full page# sizes


Changelog for 8/16/22

DetectedSeizureList.cs

Removed VisCL and implemented a new way to remove hidden channels from fast review
	This new way relies on a "backup" list (DetectedSeizuresBackup) in the Detected Seizures class that holds a deep copy of the original
	If the flag in MainForm, checkedchange, is true, the resetDFS() method will first ensure that the backup list is copied to the original, and then 
	calls the RemoveHiddenChan() method to remove the channels that are unchecked, stored in list HCL.
	
	This ensures that if one accidentally unchecks a channel, it is able to revert to the original

Created IsDisplayed() and FRIndex, which allow the program to display the count selected FR seizures on the main page, rather than the total detected.
	Implemented in Next Click, Previous, and fast review click

HCLsync() method added to sync the Hidden Channel Lists in MainForm and DSL


MainForm.cs

Created int regularReviewReturn to return the user to the seizure they were reviewing even after going into FR mode

Created bool testMode for testing

Created bool finishedReview, set automatically to false, that is set equal to true if the INI shows that the review is 100% complete
	this allows for the ability to properly rewind to the beginning when opening a finished file
	finishedReview is set to true in the ReadReviewINI method

Added delagating calls for CheckedChanged events for all 16 channels, which allows direct control over both FR and NR
Added delagating call for the channel name switch, which allows the user to either view channel names as literal or generic


added autoload for test call in Open_Click() (will be removed for release version)

Added a conditional in the Open_Click() method that will display "Finished!" if the file is marked as finished

Added a error return in the DetectionLoadButton_Click method that will stop the function if an ACQ isn't loaded


In Next_Click
